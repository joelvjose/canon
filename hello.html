        <p><strong><del>this is bold</del></strong> Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the </p>
        <p id="para1">industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen</p>
        <p id="para2"> book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised</p>
        <p class="context"> in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
